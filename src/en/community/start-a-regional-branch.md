<p>Can't find your city or region among the <a href="/en/community/regional-branches/">regional branches</a>? Then just let your own branch grow!</p>
<p>
After a few years of experience, we know that it takes at least one dedicated person to plant the seed. Helpful tools include a fixed location, regular meeting times, and communication channels that work for everyone. Weâ€™d love to support your idea with everything you need: informational materials, graphics, web space, Nextcloud storage, a mailing list, and most likely also with local networking and a conversation for experience exchange.
